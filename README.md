# Hospitality Domain Power BI Dashboard
## Project Overview
AtliQ Grands, a hotel chain is facing challenges due to increased competition and poor management decisions. Their market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category have been declining. To address this, the managing director wants to leverage ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù to regain their competitive edge. However, they lack an in-house data analytics team to provide the necessary insights. To overcome their problems I was the data analyst who was provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following tasks:
 1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.
 2. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
 3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

I worked on this project by following the Codebasics PowerBi Course, Link to the course is [here](https://codebasics.io/bootcamps/data-analytics-bootcamp-with-practical-job-assistance).

## Company‚Äôs Background
AltiQ Grands is a hotel chain based in India that has grown vastly recently. It is a company that operates in the following categories:
* Luxury
* Business
The company is facing challenges due to increased competition and poor management decisions. Their market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category have been declining. To address this, the managing director wants to leverage ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù to regain their competitive edge. However, they lack an in-house data analytics team to provide the necessary insights.

Project kick-off session, where you should get clear of what and why this project is and all other questions you have with regards to the project

### Questions to ask before starting with the dashboard
* What is the objective of building this PowerBi dashboard?
* In what terms the success of this project will be measured?
* What will be the deadline for the project?
* Do the stakeholders expect a pre-view before the actual release?
* What are all the hopes stakeholders have out of this project?
* What are all the fears the stakeholders have in terms of building this dashboard?
* Who will be using this dashboard and for what purpose?
* What are all expectations the stakeholders have, by the completion of this project?
* What can go wrong while building this project?
* What are all the resources/ data needed to build this dashboard?
* Is there any input from stakeholders in terms of design and views of the dashboard?
After the project kick-off meetings, the data engineering team has given the data as per the request of the data analytics team, let‚Äôs explore them.

### Dataset Understanding

## Importing Data into PowerBi
* As the data is in CSV files, we need to simply import the folder in Power BI and manipulate it in Power Query.
## Data Model
* Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of the report. All the visuals will be built upon the data model.
* Poor data modeling affects the overall performance of the report.
* Following Good practices of data modeling is a must.
* In this project, we have followed the Snowflake data modeling schema.

Dashboard designing
Based on the mock-ups received as requirements, I have designed the visuals and created measures.

Page Navigation
Page Navigation, is a bookmark that shows buttons to land on the desired view. The buttons are as follows:

* Overall Analysis
* Monthly Analysis

## Project Outcome
1. Over 42% of the hotel rooms are currently empty. 
2. The average customer rating is a disappointing 3.6 out of 5. 
3. An alarming 25% of customers are canceling their bookings. 
4. Most of the revenue is generated from a single city, Mumbai.

## My Suggestions
1. Implement targeted marketing campaigns to reach potential guests through social media, email marketing, and online advertising.
2. Provide exceptional service to encourage repeat business and positive word-of-mouth referrals.
3. Analyze competitor‚Äôs pricing and adjust rates to offer better value without compromising the revenue.
4. Create attractive packages for holidays, special events, or off-peak times to entice bookings.
5. Invest in property upgrades to enhance customer experience.
6. Implement flexible booking and cancellation policies to make it easier for guests to choose your hotel.
